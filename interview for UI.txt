new applications
 - room booking service

student ID
room number
how long and when it's gonna checked out for

how to verify its an appropriate person, checking credentials - check against database that it is a valid ID
how long can a person reserve for one time, how often they can reserve it
there is an issue with a booking time padding of 15 minutes that is unecessary

when booking, description of the room, how big is the room, how many chairs, if there are whiteboards
