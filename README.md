Interviewing Skills

Name: Andrew Doser

Client Name: Kody Tarbell
Phone Number: 503-703-4180

Application: Conversation Informer

This application is suppose to give key or general information on a topic that comes up for in conversation.
Once the user is alone, they can pull up the app and search key terms inform themselves on what is being spoken.
Not only so the user is not lost while in conversation, but to also hold up one end of the conversation.
The obvious focus is speed and simplicity. The user should be able to find information fast but no be flooded by it.

If the user searches for something too general and need something specific, they can choose the specific option to 
search again with another key term. Ideally, this should not happen but could happen. If the user uses the specific 
option but it is still too general, they can choose the specific option again to add a another search term.

If the user taps on general, they should get three different synopsis on the term they searched for that is around
1-2 sentences long.

If the user taps on Key facts, they should get three different facts for their searched term.

In any of these views, the user should be able to search a new term or go back one step in case of a missearch.

Due to the fact this app is meant for basic information, it will not show all information relating to the topic. It
should only show information that is the most relatable to the topic.

The problem the client is facing most, is that when they go to mixers or work events they find themself unable to hold a
conversation. This is due to people having very specialized interests or being in fields that the general populace do not
know about. The client wanted something that would not flood them with information but give only key facts or a general idea
when the searched for "item". If this app were created, it would improve upon the clients current predicament because it would
streamline his searching and allow faster rebuttals in conversation.

Purpose:

- Learn how to interview the user of an app you are designing.  
- Provide feedback to the user to see if what you are creating meets their needs.  

Often applications are developed in a vacuum. The User Interface designer creates an application they think will be helpful to their target users but finds out after spending months (and sometimes years) they didn't understand the problem or there is already a solution.  

In this SRS your job is to develop an application so you can practice interviewing potential users before starting the difficult work of creating an application.  

You must select a potential user that you don't know. A good rule of thumb is that if you know their name already, pick someone else.  

Some good sources may be school staff. You may also interview the owner of a small business or a public official. For example, TriMet has developer resources and people that you can interview regarding their software services.  

Present the problem and a proposed solution as a mobile application. Develop a set of requirements, prototype screens, storyboards, use cases, and any other materials that help you convey the idea to the class.  

We will grade each proposal and possibly create a prototype application from your idea.  

Emphasize the problem, why current solutions are inadequate, and why your proposal will improve the current situation.  

Identify the stakeholders and be sure to interview at least one representative from each type of stakeholder category.  

After you draw up your proposal, review it with the person you interviewed to be sure you captured the entire problem and your solution is adequate. 

Include the contact information of all the people you interviewed.
