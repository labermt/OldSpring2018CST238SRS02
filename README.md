Interviewing Skills

Name: 

---

Purpose:

- Learn how to interview the user of an app you are designing.  
- Provide feedback to the user to see if what you are creating meets their needs.  

Often applications are developed in a vacuum. The User Interface designer creates an application they think will be helpful to their target users but finds out after spending months (and sometimes years) they didn't understand the problem or there is already a solution.  

In this SRS your job is to develop an application so you can practice interviewing potential users before starting the difficult work of creating an application.  

You must select a potential user that you don't know. A good rule of thumb is that if you know their name already, pick someone else.  

Some good sources may be school staff. You may also interview the owner of a small business or a public official. For example, TriMet has developer resources and people that you can interview regarding their software services.  

Present the problem and a proposed solution as a mobile application. Develop a set of requirements, prototype screens, storyboards, use cases, and any other materials that help you convey the idea to the class.  

We will grade each proposal and possibly create a prototype application from your idea.  

Emphasize the problem, why current solutions are inadequate, and why your proposal will improve the current situation.  

Identify the stakeholders and be sure to interview at least one representative from each type of stakeholder category.  

After you draw up your proposal, review it with the person you interviewed to be sure you captured the entire problem and your solution is adequate. 

Include the contact information of all the people you interviewed.
